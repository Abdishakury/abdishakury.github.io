Compilation of personal and online courses projects. This portfolio, as a whole, aims to demonstrate proven experience in Data Science principals including obtaining/cleaning data, building ***Extract, Transform, Load, (ETL)*** pipelines, ***Exploratory Data Analysis*** (EDA), and building and validating ***Machine Learning*** models.

## [Project Capstone Of Sparkify](https://abdishakury.github.io/Project_Capstone_Of_Sparkify)
##### Mar 2022 – Apr 2022
In this project, I will load and manipulate a music app dataset similar to Spotify with Spark to engineer relevant features for predicting churn. Where Churn is cancelling their service altogether. By identifying these customers before they churn, the business can offer discounts and incentives to stay thereby potentially saving the business revenue. 

We will implement and test out different machine learning algorithms and the best methods have been used, here are:

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Gradient-Boosted Tree Classifier
- Linear Support Vector Machine
- Naive Bayes


### Project Motivation

For this project I was interested in predicting customer churn for a fictional music streaming company: Sparkify.

The project involved:

- Loading and cleaning a small subset (128MB) of a full dataset available (12GB) 
- Conducting Exploratory Data Analysis to understand the data and what features are useful for predicting churn
- Feature Engineering to create features that will be used in the modelling process
- Modelling using machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Trees, Linear SVM, Naive Bayes 

## [Predicting Price Seattle](https://abdishakury.github.io/Predicting-Price-Seattle)
##### Feb 2021 – Mar 2021
I was curious to look into the AirBnB dataset for Seattle. I needed to discover more about pricing patterns, customer feedback, and pricing forecasting. Some of the questions I've looked into are:
 
## [Article Recommendations](https://abdishakury.github.io/Recommendations-IBM)
##### Apr 2022
This project focuses on analyzing interactions between users and articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform. New article recommendations are made to users based on their interactions with articles. Based on the data available, we can use various methods to make these recommendations. The methods used here are **Rank Based**, **Collaborative Filtering**, and **Matrix Factorization**.


## [Disaster Response Pipeline](https://github.com/Abdishakury/abdishakur-disaster-response) | [Web-App](https://abdishakur-disaster-response.herokuapp.com/)
##### Feb 2022
 - Utilized frameworks such as **NLTK** and **Scikit-Learn** to perform ETL, build ML pipeline, and deploy ML model to a local web application.
 - The ML pipeline processes 26,000 raw text messages using NLTK and Scikit-Learn to build a multioutput classification model.
 - Maximized *F1 score* through feature engineering and parameter tuning.


## [Communicate Data Finding](https://abdishakury.github.io/Communicate_Data_Finding) 
##### May 2021
 - I will investigate Ford GoBike System Dataset, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it which called data wrangling.
 - Ford GoBike System Dataset includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area.
 - Most users are Subscribers
 - Subscribers have the lowest number of trips in the weekend holiday (Saturday and Sunday) while Customers have the lowest number of trips on Wednesday 
   and have   realtively better numbers of trips in the weekend holiday (Saturday and Sunday).
 - Most of trips are taking less than 15 mins and the top number of the trips takes about 10 mins.
 - Subscribers have narrower trip duration than Customers
 - Subscibers have more specific Trips than casual Customers
 - Most users are Subscribers and Dominant gender is Male 
 - User with Age between 25 and 35 are making top of number of trips 
 - Most of trips are taking less than 15 mins and most trips takes about 10 mins.
 - The lowest number of trips are in the weekend holiday (Saturday and Sunday) while the top number of the trips is on Thursday the last working day of the week.
 - The rush hours of number of trips are 8 (8 am)and 17 (5 pm) while the number of the trips is the least and decreasing rapidly after midnight until dawn.
 - Subscribers tends to rent bikes on working days while Customers tends to rent more in the weekend holiday (Saturday and Sunday) for longer duration.
 - Subscribers tends to rent bikes for shorter duration while Customers tends to rent bikes for longer duration
 - Both of Users type have their trips duration decreases as age increases and Subscribers of old age (60-80) have a longer trip duration and larger no of trips 
   from customers.


## [Analyze AB Test Results](https://abdishakury.github.io/Analyze_AB_Test_Results) 
##### Apr 2021 
 - Remove duplicates or records with missing or mismatched values
 - Handle the rows where the landing_page and group columns don't align
 
 Data Analytics:
- Compute probabilities of converting: 
    - regardless of page
    - Given that an individual received the treatment
    - Given that an individual received the control page
- Perform Hypothesis Testing and calculate p-values
- Conduct Logistic Regression

The findings show that the new and old pages have roughly equivalent chances of converting users, based on the statistical tests we conducted, the Z-test, logistic regression model, and actual difference identified. The null hypothesis is not rejected. I advise the e-commerce business to retain the old page. This would save you time and money by avoiding the need to establish a new website.

## [Wrangle And Analyze Data of **WeRateDogs**](https://abdishakury.github.io/wrangle-and-analyze-data)
##### Jun 2021
The dataset that I will be wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing) is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as **WeRateDogs**. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because "they're good dogs Brent." WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.
The **Tweet Image Predictions**, i.e., what breed of dog (or other object, animal, etc.) is present in each tweet according to a neural network. This file (image_predictions.tsv) is hosted on Udacity's servers and should be downloaded programmatically using the Requests library and the following **URL**: https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/August/599fd2ad_image-predictions/image-predictions.tsv
