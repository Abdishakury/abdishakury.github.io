## DATA SCIENCE PROJECTS

#### Sparkify Churn: Capstone Project | [Project Link](https://abdishakury.github.io/Project_Capstone_Of_Sparkify)
###### Apr 2022
- Loading and cleaning a small subset (128MB) of a full dataset available (12GB). 
- Conducting Exploratory Data Analysis to understand the data and what features are useful for predicting churn. 
- Feature Engineering to create features that will be used in the modelling process.
- Modelling using machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Trees, Linear SVM, Naive Bayes 



#### Disaster Response | [Project Link](https://abdishakur-disaster-response.herokuapp.com/)
###### Feb 2022
- Utilized frameworks such as NLTK and Scikit-Learn to perform ETL, build ML pipeline, and deploy ML model to a local web application. 
- The ML pipeline processes 26,000 raw text messages using NLTK and Scikit-Learn to build a multioutput classification model. 
- Maximized F1 score through feature engineering and parameter tuning.


#### Communicate Data Finding | [Project Link](https://abdishakury.github.io/Communicate_Data_Finding) 
###### May 2021
- I will investigate Ford GoBike System Dataset, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it which called data wrangling
- Ford GoBike System Dataset includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area.
- Most users are Subscribers
- Subscribers have the lowest number of trips in the weekend holiday (Saturday and Sunday) while Customers have the lowest number of trips on Wednesday 
  and have realtively better numbers of trips in the weekend holiday (Saturday and Sunday).
- Most of trips are taking less than 15 mins and the top number of the trips takes about 10 mins.
- Subscribers have narrower trip duration than Customers
- Subscibers have more specific Trips than casual Customers
- Most users are Subscribers and Dominant gender is Male
- User with Age between 25 and 35 are making top of number of trips
